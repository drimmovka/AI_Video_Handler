## Launching

<a name="project-structure"></a>

### Project structure

Input files are located in ***input*** directory. Output files will be located in ***output*** directory.
***models*** directory contains models for detecting objects (*objects_640.pt*) and digits (*digits_640.pt*).


<a name="example"></a>

### Example

Initially, a file *–í–∏–¥–µ–æ –¥–ª—è –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞.mov* is already stored in the ***input*** directory (you can put your own file in the ***input*** directory for processing).

To check if the program is working:
```bash
./run.sh --input "–í–∏–¥–µ–æ –¥–ª—è –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞.mov"
```

To find out more information about the launch flags:
```bash
./run.sh --help
```
